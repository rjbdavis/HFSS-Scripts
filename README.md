# HFSS-Scripts
A collection of general purpose scripts for HFSS using Python.

This repository contains a number of Python scripts for automating various tasks in Ansys HFSS. The design methodology is to create scripts that are mostly meant to be used from within the HFSS GUI to simplify various mundane, tedious tasks. For now, they are not meant for purely "code-based" use of HFSS as a simulator, but rather just a means to add easy-to-use features to speed up design and analysis. They are all stand alone, and do not require any additional setup to use, beyond what you would normally do when using HFSF/scripts.

Many of these are motivated by modern research on metamaterials, metasurfaces, and other artificial electromagnetic structures. Accordingly, many can be used to perform standard analyses relevant to those fields, but might still be of use to other designs if properly modified.
